## Civs - Complete RPG Plugin

**What is Civs?** Civs is a comprehensive, highly configurable RPG mechanics plugin. Mainly focused on Land Management via Towns and Regions. Also includes a robust class system.

**Installation:** Civs has a pre-configured version which is distributed by our team. It's ready to plug-and-play and also comes with a variety of custom regions, classes and skills. For a starting server, the default settings are enough to give an idea of how this plugin works. If you have any questions, first, check our wiki and if you don't find the answer, just open a ticket on our GitHub. Wiki Link: https://github.com/Multitallented/Civs/wiki
